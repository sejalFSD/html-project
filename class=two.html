    <b>introduction</b><br>
    </p>
    Mahatma Gandhi<i>was born Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, was a remarkable Indian political and civil rights leader who played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence . He's often referred to as the "Father of the Nation" and is revered for his philosophy of nonviolent resistance, which inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.</i><br>

    <b>Early life</b><br>
    </p>
    <em>In his early years, Gandhi was <u>deeply influenced </u> by the stories of Shravana and Harishchandra that reflected the importance of truth. Through these stories and from his personal experiences, he realized that truth and love are among the supreme values. Mohandas married Kasturba Makhanji at the age of 13. Gandhi later went on to reveal that the marriage didnâ€™t mean anything to him at that age and that he was happy and excited only about wearing new set of clothes. But then as days passed by, his feelings for her turned lustful, which he later confessed with regret in his autobiography.</em>

    <p>The<mark>Champaran  agitation in 1917 was the first major success of Gandhi after his arrival in India</mark> . The peasants of the area were forced by the British landlords to grow Indigo, which was a cash crop, but its demand had been declining. To make the matters worse, they were forced to sell their crops to the planters at a fixed price. The farmers turned to Gandhiji for help. Pursuing a strategy of nonviolent agitation, Gandhi took the administration by surprise and was successful in getting concessions from the authorities</p>
    <p>Farmers asked the British to relax the payment of taxes as <mark>Kheda was hit by floods in 1918</mark> . When the British failed to pay heed to the requests, Gandhi took the case of the farmers and led the protests. He instructed them to refrain from paying revenues no matter what. Later, the British gave in and accepted to relax the revenue collection and gave its word to Vallabhbhai Patel, who had represented the farmers.</p>

   The resistance of the Indian community in South Africa to discrimination increased in the years following 1906 and expanded to involve more of the indentured Indians and also Indian women. By January 1914 a compromise agreement on a variety of issues had been reached with the former General and leading South African politician, Jan Christian Smuts, and Gandhi turned his mind to preparing to leave South Africa for the last time Mohandas and Kasturba .

    <b>Education</b><br>
   <i>After his family moved to Rajkot, a nine year old Gandhi was enrolled at a local school, where he studied the basics of arithmetic, history, geography and languages. When he was 11 years old, he attended a high school in Rajkot. He lost an academic year in between because of his wedding but later rejoined the school and eventually completed his schooling. He then dropped out of Samaldas College in Bhavnagar State after joining it in the year 1888. Later Gandhi was advised by a family friend Mavji Dave Joshiji to pursue law in London.</i>
